# GB Disassembly Tools

These scripts were written to for working with the Pok√©mon disassembly projects. Some were previously tracked in [pokecrystal][pokecrystal], with duplicates in [pokegold][pokegold], [pokered][pokered], and [pokeyellow][pokeyellow]. Others have since been ported from elsewhere or newly written.

Python scripts require Python 3.9 or newer.

Some of these scripts are niche, and some are more broadly applicable.
